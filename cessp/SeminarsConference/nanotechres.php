It is not only aimed at sharing the ideas, it envisages a mutual collaboration between the various Universities and Research Institutes. Therefore, you are welcome to bring along posters encompassing your groups research facilities” said the introductory leaflet that was sent to many different Universities and Research Organizations. This one day National meeting was a huge success and some 130 faculty and students participated in this event. 13 invited and contribute talks were presented during this meeting. <a href="<?php echo URL; ?>sample\Abstracts_meet_nano_2010.pdf"><strong>Click here to download The programme and abstracts of the talks .</strong></a> (Use Adobe Acrobat Reader to open this file)</p>
