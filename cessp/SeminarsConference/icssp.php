            <p align="justify">International Conference on Solid State Physics (ICSSP’13) is going to be held during 02 – 06 December, 2013 at Centre of Excellence in Solid State Physics, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. Original research articles in all sub-disciplines of Solid State Physics are invited.

Be sure to include ICSSP’13 in your conference plans for 2013. Whether you attend the conference as a listener or you wish to contribute some research work at International platform, you will have the opportunity to attend fascinating conference sessions. ICSSP’13 will also give you an opportunity to listen to more than 15 INVITED TALKS of experts from all over the world. Another compelling part of ICSSP’13 is SCIENTIFIC EXHIBITION in which various manufacturers will display their equipment along with their technical details.

ICSSP’13 will be divided into five concurrent technical symposia / sessions A through E addressing experimental, theoretical, and manufacturing issues associated with the development of new materials &amp; processes, and evolving approaches to scale-up for commercial applications.</p>
